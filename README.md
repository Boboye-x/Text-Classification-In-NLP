In recent times, individuals take to social media to express their feelings and emotions which might indicate symptoms of depression, albeit difficult to diagnose. Research employing user-generated social media posts has been carried out to detect symptomatic signs of depression. In this paper, machine learning models such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and attention-based Transformers have been applied to classify posts suggesting depressive language. Extensive preprocessing steps, including tokenization, lemmatization, n-gram modeling, and vectorization using TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, and Word2Vec embedding, were applied to generate rich contextual meaning and capture semantic relationships. The attention-based Transformer model achieved a ROC-AUC score of 0.99 and an F1-score of 0.94, emerging as the most effective model after fine-tuning. The results supplement the prospect of NLP in detecting depression early, specifically through the use of deep learning architectures capable of capturing complex linguistic patterns in informal discourse
